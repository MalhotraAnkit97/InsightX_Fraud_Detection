**Analyzing Patterns of Deception: A Comprehensive Analysis of Credit Card Fraud Detection Through Data Science**

**Introduction**

*Background of Data*

In this modern time, the phenomenon of credit card fraud has evolved into a sophisticated challenge that plagues financial institutions worldwide. Nowadays, especially after the pandemic, more people rely on online transactions, such as using credit cards on websites, shopping on Amazon or any other platform, and transferring money using online banking. The opportunities for fraudulent transactions have increased, leading to significant financial losses and eroding consumer trust. It has come to our attention that we have seen a lot of news online about people stealing other people’s credit card credentials by secretly recording their information and using them on their own. 

This research delves into the complexities of credit card fraud by leveraging a rich dataset that includes multiple important variables. This dataset enables us to further test and train our theories while doing our research. These variables testify to fraudulent transactions' intricate patterns and behaviors, providing a solid foundation for analysis, understanding, and research.

*Variable of Interest*

The dataset at the heart of this study is characterized by a wide array of variables, ranging from transaction details such as amount, time, date, and location (using long and lat), to more detailed indicators that may signal fraudulent behavior. Among these, one variable is used to determine if the transaction is fraudulent: "is_fraud,” with numeric 1 indicating positive fraud, while “0” indicates negative fraud. In the further analysis, we will also use feature engineering to further expand our numeric variables to train and test our hypothesis. The exploration of these variables not only aids in identifying the potential of fraudulent transactions but also enriches our understanding of the operational tactics employed by fraudsters.

*Business Operations*

This research is driven by a series of compelling business questions that seek to answer and illuminate the dark corners of credit card fraud. At this core, the study aims to answer the following research questions:

1. What are the distinguishing characteristics of fraudulent transactions as opposed to legitimate ones?
2. Can transactional patterns and behaviors predictive of fraud be accurately identified and quantified?
3. How can financial institutions leverage predictive modeling to identify, reduce, or mitigate fraud transactions?
4. What are the implications of fraud detection mechanisms on consumer trust and financial security?

Answering these questions not only contributes to the academic discussion about financial fraud but also provides actionable insights for businesses dealing with the threat of credit card fraud. This research strives to provide a beacon of hope in the fight against credit card fraud through a multi-staged and complex exploration of the dataset and the application of data science methods.


**Data Analysis**

*Data Overwiew*

Our dataset downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data?select=fraudTrain.csv includes two CSV files: fraudtrain and fraudtest. The train set contains more than 1 million data points, which we use in this research to perform visualization, run the model, and answer business questions. This data contains legitimate and fraudulent transactions from the 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers 1000 customers' credit cards doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants, with 23 variables. Variables related to personal information include first and last, gender, date of birth, zip, state, street, city, and job. These variables are related to transaction information such as trans date, trans time, cc num, merchant, and category. There is also other information, such as the city population where customers live, the latitude and longitude of customers, and the merchants. The dependent variable is is_fraud, which we determine when running the model to evaluate the criteria related to a transaction with which factors are considered at risk of fraud or not.

| Variable Name | Description |
|---------|---------|
| index| Unique Identifier for each row|
| trans_date_trans_time| Transaction DateTime |
| cc_num| Credit Card Number of Customer|
| merchant| Merchant Name|
| category| Category of Merchant|
| amt| Amount of Transaction|
| first| First Name of Credit Card Holder|
| last| Last Name of Credit Card Holder|
| gender | Gender of Credit Card Holder|
| street | Street Address of Credit Card Holder|
| city| City of Credit Card Holder|
| state| State of Credit Card Holder|
| zip| Zip of Credit Card Holder|
| lat| Latitude Location of Credit Card Holder|
| long| Longitude Location of Credit Card Holder|
| city_pop| Credit Card Holder's City Population|
| job| Job of Credit Card Holder|
| trans_num| Transaction Number|
| unix_time| UNIX Time of transaction|
| merch_lat| Latitude Location of Merchant|
| merch_long| Longitude Location of Merchant|
| **is_fraud**| **Fraud Flag <-- Target Class**| 

*Data Cleaning*

The data preparation process involved several crucial steps to ensure the dataset's suitability for analysis and model training in the later section. After importing the data, we use "glimpse" to get an overview of the number of variables, variable types, and rows in the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
credit_df <- read.csv("fraudTrain.csv")
glimpse(credit_df)
```


After considering the variables needed to use the data and run the model, we eliminate several variables, including X, last, first, street, trans_num, unix_time, cc_num, and zip. This elimination also helps reduce data volume during data runs in R while not distracting from more important variables. We do not eliminate all location variables, so we only retain variables related to customer and merchant locations, as well as state and city. Next, we check to see if the data had missing values or duplicated data, and fortunately, there are no data NAs or duplicated ones, so we move to the next step of converting some categorical variables into numbers.

```{r}
new_credit <- select(credit_df, -X, -first, -last, -street, -trans_num, -unix_time, -cc_num, -zip)
which(is.na(new_credit))
duplicates <- new_credit[duplicated(new_credit), ]
duplicates
```

Initially, we transform gender variables: Female to 1 and Male to 0, facilitating more straightforward analysis and interpretation. Next, the "dob" variable is converted to Age to provide a more intuitive understanding of the customers' age. In addition, we also change the type of these two variables from character to factor for the gender variable and from character to integer for the age variable to facilitate analysis in the following steps.

```{r}
new_credit$gender <- as.factor(ifelse(new_credit$gender == "M", 0, 1))
new_credit$is_fraud <- as.factor(new_credit$is_fraud)
```

```{r}
dob_date <- as.Date(new_credit$dob)
current_date <- Sys.Date()

# Calculate age
new_credit$age <- as.integer(difftime(current_date, dob_date, units = "weeks") / 52.25)
credit_new <- select(new_credit, -dob)
```


Our Dataset included more than a million records (and this was just the train_dataset). As a sample, we decided to take on 10,000 as an apt number taking in consideration how we wanted to process several visualizations. It worked out best for us, and the random sampling gave us near to same as the raw data.

```{r}
set.seed(219) # DO NOT CHANGE
selected_df <- credit_new[sample(nrow(new_credit), 10000), ]
```

Next, we convert the unit to the "amt" variable because, in general, this variable is in thousands of dollars, which shows a minimal number and can affect the visualization of this variable. Therefore, we convert the unit to dollars for a clearer view, and the chart will look more straightforward. We are also interested in the timing of transactions as this can be a potential variable in assessing whether a transaction is fraudulent. We extract hours, minutes, and seconds from the variable trans_date_trans_time and create three new columns for this extraction. At the same time, we make subsets from the 10000 data by filtering is_fraud = 1 and is_fraud = 0 for more convenient analysis. More importantly, we check again for missing variables in this dataset of 10,000 records.

```{r}
#Convert amt in thousands dollar to dollar
selected_df <- mutate(selected_df, amt_new = amt*1000)

# Extract hour, minute and second from trans_date_trans_time
datatime <- strptime(selected_df$trans_date_trans_time, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
time_in_hr <- format(datatime, "%H" )
time_in_min <- format(datatime, "%M")
time_in_sec <- format(datatime, "%S")

# Create 3 new columns for hour, minute and second
selected_df$hour <- as.numeric(time_in_hr)
selected_df$minute <- as.numeric(time_in_min)
selected_df$second <- as.numeric(time_in_sec)

# Create 2 subsets with fraud = 1, non-fraud = 0 
subset_fraud <- subset(selected_df, is_fraud == 1)
subset_nonFraud <- subset(selected_df, is_fraud == 0)
View(selected_df)

#Re-check missing values in selected_df
which(is.na(selected_df))
```


*Data Visualization*

In this section, we will use different chart types, such as bar, pie, boxplot, scatter, histogram, and line charts, to represent variables in the data. Because we have both categorical and numerical variables, using a variety of charts will help us have a more multidimensional view of the data to support running models and getting insights.
First of all, to get an overview of the number of fraudulent and legitimate transactions in the data, we draw a pie chart that best shows the number and percentage of each component. The results showed that out of a total of 10,000 data, only 66 were recorded as fraudulent transactions, and 9,934 were legitimate transactions. From this finding, we detect an imbalance in the data, and we will balance it using SMOTE before running the model in the data model section.

```{r}
fraud_count <- as.data.frame(table(selected_df$is_fraud))
fraud_count$label <- cumsum(fraud_count$Freq) - 0.5 * fraud_count$Freq

ggplot(fraud_count, aes(x = "", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "white") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(y = label, label = Freq), color = "black", size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Pie chart for Number of Transactions Type", fill = "Fraud Status") +
  theme_void()
```

Next, we want to see the customer purchasing categories in this data and their distribution. As a result, transactions such as gasoline, housing, groceries in-store, and kids_pets account for the most significant number, while transactions for travel and online groceries account for the least. It is reasonable because these transactions provide basic human needs such as transportation and food, followed by shopping and leisure.

```{r}
freq_cate <- table(selected_df$category)
categories <- as.data.frame(freq_cate )
names(categories) <- c("Category", "Value")
ggplot(categories, aes(x = Category, y = Value, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Value), vjust = -0.3) + #vjust: adjust to avoid overlapping bars
  theme(legend.position = "none", #hide the legend
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1, size = 12)) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Value")
```

We use a boxplot to determine how much customers spend in these categories by sorting them by mean. We found that, on average, customers spend the most on in-store groceries, followed by travel and online shopping. The two charts show that although the number of shopping and travel transactions is small, the amount of money customers spend on them is still significant. This result is understandable because the prices of products in these two categories are often higher than those of groceries.

```{r}
var_new <- filter(selected_df, amt < 20000)

ggplot(var_new) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(category, amt, FUN = mean), y = amt, color = category)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1, size = 10)) +
  xlab("")+
  ylab("Amount") +
  coord_flip()
```

We are also interested in whether the payouts in transactions involved fraud. The boxplot below shows that, on average, there is a significant difference between fraudulent transactions and legitimate transactions. This result indicates that the "amt" variable is essential in identifying whether a transaction is fraudulent.
```{r}
ggplot(var_new) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = is_fraud, y = amt_new, group = is_fraud)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1, size = 12)) +
  labs(x = "Fraud Status", y = "Amount", title = "Boxplot for Fraud and Amount")
```

Diving deeper into fraudulent transactions, we examine how these transactions are distributed across purchase categories. Among the 66 fraudulent transactions, the grocery_pos variable accounts for the majority with 16 transactions, followed by shopping_net with 12 transactions. The chart below shows that criminals mostly commit fraud using credit cards through in-store groceries and online shopping transactions.

```{r}
ggplot(subset_fraud) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = is_fraud, fill = category), position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(stat = 'count', aes(x = is_fraud, label = after_stat(count), group = category), 
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.25) +
  labs(title = "Number of Fraudulent Transactions by Category", 
       y = "Number of Transactions", x = "Fraud Status") +
  theme_minimal()
```

To have a clearer view of the number of transactions made by male or female customers, we use a bar plot to compare these two values. The results below show that female customers in this dataset made more transactions than men across every purchase category. From this point, the gender variable would be a potential variable for model fraud classification.
```{r}
ggplot(selected_df) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = category), position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Category by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Frequnecy") +
  theme_gray()
```

When we plot pie charts for fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions by gender, the results are what we expected. The pie chart below shows that fraudulent transactions are higher for females than males. On the contrary, the rate of non-fraudulent transactions occurring with female customers is lower than that of men.

```{r}
gender_fraud <- subset_fraud %>%
  group_by(is_fraud, gender) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')


gender_nonFraud <- subset_nonFraud %>%
  group_by(is_fraud, gender) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

gender_fraud <- gender_fraud%>%
  group_by(is_fraud) %>%
  mutate(percentage = count/sum(count)*100)
  
  
gender_nonFraud <- gender_nonFraud%>%
  group_by(is_fraud) %>%
  mutate(percentage0 = count / sum(count) * 100)

ggplot(gender_fraud, aes(x = "", y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", color = "white") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  facet_wrap(~ is_fraud) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Male and Female in Fraudulent Transactions", x = "", y = "", fill = "Gender") +
  theme_void()

ggplot(gender_nonFraud, aes(x = "", y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", color = "pink") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  facet_wrap(~ is_fraud) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage0, 1), "%")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Male and Female in Non-Fraudulent Transactions", x = "", y = "", fill = "Gender") +
  theme_void()
```



```{r}
ggplot(selected_df) +
geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(is_fraud, age, FUN = median), y = age, fill = is_fraud)) +
labs(x = "Fraud Status", y = "Age", title = "Boxplot for Fraud and Age", fill = "Fraud Status") +
coord_flip()
```

Besides examining customer's information, we also check distribution of fraudulent transactions across different states in the dataset and found out a comparative look at fraudulent transactions across states. It is worth noting that some states have a higher frequency of fraud, such as NY, IL, MI, and WA, which may indicate targeted areas or areas with security measures in place weaker security. This visualization will be a basis for analyzing state patterns and developing region-specific anti-fraud strategies.
```{r}
ggplot(subset_fraud) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = is_fraud, fill = state), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Fraudulent Transactions by State", y = "Number of Transactions")
```

Moving to numerical variables, we plot a scatter plot to compare the relationship between age and transaction amount for fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions. The first scatter plot suggests that fraudulent transactions involve higher amounts among the younger age groups, ranging from 20 to 40, than those older. This means the younger the customers, the more fraudulent transactions are involved among these groups. The data points show considerable variation in fraudulent transaction amounts across ages, with a wider confidence interval at age extremes indicating less certainty about the average amount for these age groups. The second graph suggests non-fraudulent transactions without a clear pattern.

```{r}
# Scatter plot for fraud cases
ggplot(subset_fraud) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = amt)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = age, y = amt), method = "loess")

# Non-fraud
ggplot(subset_nonFraud) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = amt)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = age, y = amt), method = "loess")

```


We are also interested in the amount of money frequency in fraudulent transactions, as this would be a potential factor in assessing whether a transaction amount is fraudulent. This histogram illustrates the distribution of transaction amounts for fraud cases. Most fraudulent transactions cluster at lower amounts, suggesting that fraudsters may prefer smaller, less noticeable amounts to go around detection. This insight is crucial for adjusting fraud detection algorithms to be sensitive to transactions of varying amounts. The histograms of non-fraudulent transactions show different patterns compared to fraudulent cases. Most legitimate transactions are concentrated in significantly lower dollar amounts. The distribution is heavily skewed to the left, indicating that the monetary value of regular customer transactions is generally smaller. The apparent difference in the distribution of amounts for fraud and non-fraud cases may indicate the behavior distinguishing legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones.

```{r}
ggplot(subset_fraud, aes(x = amt)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 32, fill = "beige", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Amount for Fraud Cases",
       x = "Amount",
       y = "Frequency")

ggplot(subset_nonFraud, aes(x = amt)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 32, fill = "pink", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Amount for Non-Fraud Cases",
       x = "Amount",
       y = "Frequency")
```

The age distribution of non-fraudulent transactions shows wide dispersion across age groups, with certain age ranges exhibiting higher transaction frequencies. This histogram provides insight into the population's demographic patterns of credit card usage. It can serve as a baseline for understanding typical user profiles in the context of fraud detection. The age histogram associated with fraudulent transactions presents a more diverse distribution than non-fraudulent cases, although the overall frequency is lower due to the relative rarity of fraud. Certain age groups appear to be more likely to be associated with fraudulent activity, or conversely, they may be the age group that fraudsters choose to impersonate. This data helps identify high-risk demographics, and fraud prevention measures may be developed accordingly.

```{r}
ggplot(subset_fraud, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "beige", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Age for Fraud Cases",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency")

ggplot(subset_nonFraud, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Age for Non-Fraud Cases",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency")
```


The time factor is also essential in determining whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent because it can be based on the transaction history to diagnose whether the credit card holder made a transaction at an unusual time. We use the hour variable and gender to consider transactions in different time frames.
```{r}
hour_gender_female <- selected_df %>%
  filter(gender == 1) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

hour_gender_male <- selected_df %>%
  filter(gender == 0) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

hour_gender_female$gender <- 'Female'
hour_gender_male$gender <- 'Male'

# Combine the two data frames
hour_gender_combined <- rbind(hour_gender_female, hour_gender_male)

ggplot(hour_gender_combined, aes(x = hour, y = Count, color = gender, group = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Number of transactions", x = "Hour", title = "Number of Transactions by Hour and Gender") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Female" = "orange", "Male" = "skyblue")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
hour_gender_F <- subset_fraud %>%
  filter(gender == 1) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

hour_gender_M <- subset_fraud %>%
  filter(gender == 0) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

hour_gender_F$gender <- 'Female'
hour_gender_M$gender <- 'Male'

# Combine the two data frames
hour_gender_FM <- rbind(hour_gender_F, hour_gender_M)

ggplot(hour_gender_FM, aes(x = hour, y = Count, color = gender, group = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Number of fraudulent transactions", x = "Hour", title = "Number of Fraudulent Transactions by Hour and Gender") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Female" = "coral", "Male" = "green")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
hour_female <- subset_nonFraud %>%
  filter(gender == 1) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

hour_male<- subset_nonFraud %>%
  filter(gender == 0) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

hour_female$gender <- 'Female'
hour_male$gender <- 'Male'

# Combine the two data frames
hour_male_female<- rbind(hour_female, hour_male)

ggplot(hour_male_female, aes(x = hour, y = Count, color = gender, group = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Number of non-fraudulent transactions", x = "Hour", title = "Number of Non-Fraudulent Transactions by Hour and Gender") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Female" = "pink", "Male" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()
```


Overall, non-fraudulent transactions are higher in volume and show a distinct peak in the evening for both genders, with females engaging in more transactions than males. This is understandable because this is the normal living time from waking up to going to sleep. While lower in volume, as expected, fraud transactions increase significantly in the late hours, particularly for females. Given their higher volume, the total number of transactions by hour closely follows the pattern of non-fraudulent transactions. For all types of transactions, evening hours are the peak time for transaction activity.

That said, there is a higher risk of fraudulent transactions occurring when the credit card holder is sleeping or not working than at night. This supports the construction of an anti-fraud system that detects fraud within the time frame from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., which will help to better intervene in fraud issues. Additionally, the results show that hours are a significant variable in determining whether or not fraud is committed.

*Data Modeling*

The detection of credit card fraud has become a critical issue in the financial sector due to the increasing sophistication of fraudulent activities. In this part of the report, we present our approach to building predictive models for detecting credit card fraud cases using machine learning techniques. We leverage our dataset containing various features related to credit card transactions, including demographic information, transaction details, and geographic location.

Before building predictive models, we performed several preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis:
  1.We converted categorical variables such as gender, region, and job type into numerical format to facilitate modeling.
  2.We calculated the age of individuals based on their date of birth to incorporate this important demographic variable into our analysis.
  3.We sampled a subset of the data for modeling purposes due to computational constraints.

*1a. Logistic Regression Modeling*
*Data Exploration and Feature Engineering:*
Before fitting the logistic regression models, we conducted thorough data exploration to understand the distribution and characteristics of our features. We identified potential predictors such as transaction amount, gender, age, city population, region, and job type. To enhance the predictive power of our models, we engineered additional features, including polynomial terms for transaction amount and age, as well as interaction terms between transaction amount and age.

# selected_df_for_modelling <- selected_df_for_modelling[sample(nrow(selected_df_for_modelling), 1000), ]
# Logistic Regression model 1
selected_df_for_modelling$is_fraud <- as.factor(selected_df_for_modelling$is_fraud)
logistic_model_1 <- glm(is_fraud ~  . -lat -long -merch_lat -merch_long,
                        data = selected_df_for_modelling,
                        family = binomial)

*Model Building and Evaluation:*
We fitted two logistic regression models to the preprocessed dataset. The first model, referred to as Model 1, included the initial set of features without any additional complexity. Through iterative model refinement and feature selection, we aimed to strike a balance between model complexity and predictive performance. The second model, Model 2, incorporated the enhanced feature set with polynomial and interaction terms.

*Performance Metrics:*
The performance of the logistic regression models was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy and precision. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, while precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made. Both models exhibited high accuracy and precision on the training data, indicating their effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.



*Random Forest Modeling*
*Algorithm Overview:*
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and predictions are aggregated through a voting mechanism to produce the final classification.


```{r}
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
rf_model <- randomForest(is_fraud ~ ., data = selected_df_for_modelling)
predictions <- predict(rf_model, selected_df_for_modelling)
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(predictions, selected_df_for_modelling$is_fraud)
accuracy <- conf_matrix$overall["Accuracy"]
precision <- conf_matrix$byClass["Pos Pred Value"]
print(paste("Accuracy:", round(accuracy, 4)))
print(paste("Precision:", round(precision, 4)))
```

*Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:*
We trained a Random Forest model on the preprocessed dataset, leveraging the randomForest package in R. To optimize model performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal values for parameters such as the number of trees and the maximum depth of each tree. Cross-validation techniques were employed to assess model generalization and prevent overfitting.
*Evaluation and Performance Analysis:*
The performance of the Random Forest model was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy and precision. The model demonstrated exceptional performance on the training data, achieving near-perfect accuracy and precision. We also examined feature importance to gain insights into the factors driving fraudulent transactions, providing valuable information for fraud detection strategies.


*5. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Modeling*
*Theory and Application:*
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for classification tasks. SVMs find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between the classes. SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are capable of handling non-linear decision boundaries through the use of kernel functions.


```{r}
# install.packages("e1071")
library(e1071)
svm_model <- svm(is_fraud ~ ., data = selected_df_for_modelling, kernel = "radial")
predictions <- predict(svm_model, selected_df_for_modelling)
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(predictions, selected_df_for_modelling$is_fraud)
accuracy <- conf_matrix$overall["Accuracy"]
precision <- conf_matrix$byClass["Pos Pred Value"]
print(paste("Accuracy:", round(accuracy, 4)))
print(paste("Precision:", round(precision, 4)))

```


*Model Training and Kernel Selection:*
We employed the SVM algorithm to build a predictive model for credit card fraud detection. The radial basis function (RBF) kernel, a popular choice for SVMs, was selected to handle non-linear relationships between features. The SVM model was trained on the preprocessed dataset, with hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter (C) and kernel coefficient (gamma) optimized through grid search.
*Performance Evaluation and Interpretation:*
The performance of the SVM model was assessed using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy and precision. Despite its simplicity, the SVM model exhibited competitive performance compared to more complex algorithms such as Random Forest. Feature weights were analyzed to understand the contribution of each feature to the classification decision, providing valuable insights into the underlying patterns of credit card fraud.
